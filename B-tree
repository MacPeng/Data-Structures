***Properties of B-Tree: 

1. All leaves are at the same level.
2. A B-Tree is defined by the term minimum degree ‘t’. The value of t depends upon disk block size.
3. Every node except root must contain at least (ceiling)([t-1]/2) keys. The root may contain minimum 1 key.
4. All nodes (including root) may contain at most t – 1 keys.
5. Number of children of a node is equal to the number of keys in it plus 1.
6. All keys of a node are sorted in increasing order. The child between two keys k1 and k2 contains all keys in the range from k1 and k2.
7. B-Tree grows and shrinks from the root which is unlike Binary Search Tree. Binary Search Trees grow downward and also shrink from downward.
8. Like other balanced Binary Search Trees, time complexity to search, insert and delete is O(log n).
9. Insertion of a Node in B-Tree happens only at Leaf Node.
